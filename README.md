# Landing-Page

This is a good project for me to practice on what i have learned, including flexbox. 
i would say after doing this project, i need to practice more in order to be more proficient in creating landing pages better than this one. 
I did google some tutorials on things that i got stuck on. 
i need to work on alignment, such as having a more aligned content (e.g. margin, padding etc.)
i also need to work on some design elements, such as color scheme and scannabiilty, font-style etc.
but overall this was a very fun project, i enjoyed it immensely.
